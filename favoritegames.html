  <h1>My Top 5 Games</h1>
  <h3>1.) Hotline Miami 1 & 2</h3>
  <p>Genre: Top-Down Shooter</p>
  <p>Personal Score: 9.5/10</p>
  <p><strong>Favorite Part:</strong></p>

  <p>I could unironically ramble for hours on hours about how much I love this game. The unique asthetic, the heart-pumping gameplay, the club-esc music, the story-telling. This whole game is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. The best description I can give is that it goes from being an adrenaline rush to being a quiet graveyard in the matter of seconds.</p>
  <h3>2.) Bioshock</h3>
  <p>Genre: FPS, Horror</p>
  <p>Personal Score: 9/10</p>
  <p><strong>Favorite Part:</strong></p>
  <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG25S51qJQQ" title="Bioshock - A man chooses, a slave obeys" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>To this day, Bioshock remains quite possibly the most interesting game I have ever played. The setting is both calming and peaceful, yet eerie and chilling. The incredible plot devices, character backgrounds, stories, worldbuilding. Bioshock (at least the first and original) is something that I think most game developers of modern should look upon for inspiration on how to do both survival horror and story-telling.</p>
  <h3>3.) Left 4 Dead 2</h3>
  <p>Genre: FPS, Zombies</p>
  <p>Personal Score: 10/10</p>
  <p><strong>Favorite Part:</strong></p>
  <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qgs8Pg0yxLE" title="Left 4 Dead 2 - Walkthrough Part 7 Gameplay Hard Rain" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>This is the pinnacle of multiplayer experiences. Most modern games made today don't have nearly the level of complexity that this old game does. The levels are proceduraly edited to fit to the current situation of the players. Have a lot of med-kits and ammo? Here comes a big horde and a Tank. Have a whole lot of nothing, and someone's dead? Here's some supply. The game rapidly changes and become a new, fresh experience over hundreds of playthroughs. And of course, there are plenty of modded campaigns to play as well.</p>
  <h3>4.) Super Mario Galaxy</h3>
  <p>Genre: Platformer</p>
  <p>Personal Score: 9/10</p>
  <p><strong>Favorite Part:</strong></p>
  <iframe width="1017" height="763" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c20jLWUkmZw" title="Super Mario Galaxy - Story intro" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Yes, the introduction to the game is still my favorite part. As a whole, Super Mario Galaxy would just be another Mario game if not for certain things that differ slightly. Some of the music tracks are much slower than tradtional Mario OST, the story is a lot more involved rather than just being "Save the Princess", and the level design is so unique and fun that the game can be played over and over again like it was the first time doing so.</p>
  <h3>5.) Outlast Series</h3>
  <p>Genre: Horror</p>
  <p>Personal Score: 8.5/10</p>
  <p><strong>Favorite Part:</strong></p>
  <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIBIj6ulBZs" title="Outlast Whistleblower |ENDING! Miles Upshr IS ALIVE!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Not a game for the faint of heart, mind you. Outlast is a genre-defining horror experience, one that truly pushes the boundaries of games in its genre and allowed for innovation on the formula. Both games have very dark and extreme themes, mostly surrounding religion and human experimentation. The recently released Outlast Trials also helps to push the series forward, completely innovating on the multiplayer survival-horror experience.</p>
